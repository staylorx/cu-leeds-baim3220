    ">- Lists and the list-like tuple can contain multiple values which makes it easier to write programs that handle large amounts of data\n",
    ">> - `List Definition`: a *list* is a value that contains multiple values in an ordered sequence\n",
    ">>>- Lists start with a `[` and end with a `]`\n",
    ">>- *List value* vs values in a list\n",
    ">>>- The *list value* is the value associated with the entire list and can be stored in a variable or passed to functions like any other value\n",
    ">>>- Values within a list are also known as *items* \n",
    "\n",
    "# When do we typically use lists? \n",
    ">- Lists are one of the most common data structures programmers use\n",
    ">- And the short answer is that we use lists whenever we have a need that matches the list data structure's useful features such as:\n",
    "1. We use lists if we need to maintain order. \n",
    ">>- By order we don't me sorted order, just listed order. But we will learn how to sort lists as well. \n",
    "2. If you need to access the contents randomly by a number\n",
    ">>- Items in a list are all associated with an index number so we can access various data types within a list by the index number\n",
    "3. If we need to go through the contents linearly (i.e., first to last)\n",
    ">>- And this is where `for-loops` come into play because they go through a list from start to end\n",
    "\n",
    "## So ask yourself these questions to see if you want to use a list in Python\n",
    "1. Do you want an ordered list of something? \n",
    "2. Do you want to store the ordered list?\n",
    "3. Do you want to access the things in the list randomly or linearly?\n",
