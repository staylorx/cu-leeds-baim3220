# Final Project

Part of learning to program is building something useful, learning something new, or testing a hypothesis.

An ideal project asks a business question (your hypothesis). And then goes forward to answer that question. Sometimes the answer might be different than what you set out to find. That's okay. As long as it's clean, interesting, and presented well, you'll do fine. 

Imagine this notebook is going to be presented to your CFO, your chief revenue person, your marketing director.

## Questions I've seen in the past

While it's great if a question is specific to the business school, it _doesn't have to be_. Pick something interesting to you, and create an "ideal reader," i.e., your target audience for your report. Of course your ideal reader might be you. That's okay. :)

1. What are the chances that a basketball team will win?
2. Converting a single Excel file with N rows into N Word documents.
3. Lots of finance questions (equity valuations, bond yields, etc.). I _never_ tire of these btw.
4. Simple machine-learning classification ideas. An example is [here](https://github.com/staylorx/cu-leeds-baim3220/blob/main/Extras/Using%20scikit-learn%20to%20classify%20and%20predict.ipynb), but also piles of good ideas at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
    * If you use data from kaggle or other sorts, be sure to cite where you got it.
5. Basic statistics against Twitter data (esp. popular for folks taking a marketing class).
6. I used a 2nd grade homework assignment as a game. I took something very simple and answered a question that was bothering me. [Steps and Leaps](https://github.com/staylorx/cu-leeds-baim3220/blob/main/Extras/Steps%20and%20Leaps.ipynb)
    * I got carried away, and added a bunch of functions and tricks and orchestration. But that's me. Use what you know.
7. A simple task-tracker that analysed how much time a student took studying for each class.
8. Your idea here!

## Requirements

1. Python 3. Obviously. :)
2. A Jupyter Notebook with markdown and commented code
3. Your code runs with zero syntax errors.
4. Any code (and data) brought in from the world (stackoverflow, kaggle, etc.) must be cited.
5. Be sure I can access the code for the notebook; either submit the data with your assignment, or point me towards it online.

## Pick at least two features

1. Two or more visualizations (charts using matplotlib, seaborn, anything you like). If you're already using Pandas, this will be a snap.
2. Some level of analytics that helps support the answer to your questions; this should be Pandas, but I've seen the rare exception.
3. One or more reusable function(s)
4. Input and output from various sources:
    * Microsoft Word
    * Microsoft Excel
    * APIs HTTP/Request
    * CSV, parquet, or other data formats
5. Machine-learning algorithm (classification, e.g., are easier than you think)
6. Come up with something new!
