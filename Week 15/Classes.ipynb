    "# Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Python may be used in an object-oriented model. [1] In the example below I create a \"base\" (or super) class called Canine, then create individual Classes (Dog and Wolf) that are said to \"inherit\" from the super class.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we've learned as functions, when encapsulated within a class, we call methods. Any other variable reference in a class is known as a property.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if the number_of_wheels is a property of a class called Vehicle, I might derive sub-classes called Trike (with number_of_wheels == 3), and Car (with number_of_wheels >= 4). \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of classes as blueprints for creating -- we say instantiating -- unique instances of a a thing in memory. In the examples below, `fido = Dog(\"Fido\")`, fido is a _variable_ that holds/points-to the _instance_ of the _class_ Dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does Dog inherit properties and methods from the Canine class? Yes. The `__init__` method in a class is also known as a \"constructor\", and can be thought of \"starting-up\" (or constructing) the instance from the blueprint/class. Calling super() calls the start-up process on the inherited class. E.g., calling `super()` in the Dog class, first runs the `__init__` in Canine, then runs the rest of the Python in the __init__ in Dog.\n",
